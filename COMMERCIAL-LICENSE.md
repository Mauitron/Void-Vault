## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What if my revenue grows past $100K after I start using the AGPL version?

**A:** You should contact us to purchase a commercial license, at the latest,
ONE month after your revenue exceeds $100K. We offer reasonable transition
terms for growing businesses.

### Q: Can I try Void Vault before purchasing a commercial license?

**A:** Yes! You can evaluate Void Vault under the AGPL-3.0 license.
Development and testing do not require a commercial license, only production
deployment in commercial products.

Q: What if I only want to use Void Vault internally (not distribute it)?
A: Internal use depends on how you deploy Void Vault:

Standalone desktop use (each employee runs it locally): AGPL-3.0 allows this
without requiring a commercial license, even for companies over $100K.
You don't need to provide source code to employees unless you've modified the software.
Network/web-based deployment (employees access via browser/network): Under AGPL Section 13,
you must offer the complete source code (including any modifications) to all users who
interact with it over the network. If you're comfortable doing this with your employees,
AGPL-3.0 is sufficient.

Want to avoid Section 13 obligations: Purchase an "Internal Use" commercial license,
which removes the requirement to provide source code to your employees for network-based
deployments.

### Q: What if I only want to use Void Vault internally (not distribute it)?

**A:** Internal use by companies over $100K revenue is permitted under AGPL-3.0
as long as you comply with its terms. You only need a commercial license if you
want to avoid AGPL obligations (like providing source code to network users per AGPL Section 13).

### Q: Do I need a license for each developer or each deployment?

**A:** Licensing is typically per-organization, not per-developer.
The number of deployments affects tier selection, not the base requirement
for a license.

### Q: What happens if I use Void Vault commercially without a license?

**A:** Unauthorized commercial use violates copyright law and the AGPL-3.0 terms.
We reserve the right to enforce our license terms. Please contact us to ensure proper licensing,
we're happy to work with you.

### Q: Can I get a refund if the commercial license doesn't work for me?

**A:** Commercial licenses include a 30-day evaluation period.
Contact us if you have concerns during this period.
