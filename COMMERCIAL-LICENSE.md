## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What if my revenue grows past $100K after I start using the AGPL version?

**A:** You should contact us to purchase a commercial license, at the latest,
ONE month after your revenue exceeds $100K. We offer reasonable transition
terms for growing businesses.

### Q: Can I try Void Vault before purchasing a commercial license?

**A:** Yes! You can evaluate Void Vault under the AGPL-3.0 license.
Development and testing do not require a commercial license, only production
deployment in commercial products.

### Q: What if I only want to use Void Vault internally (not distribute it)?

**A:** Internal use by companies over $100K revenue is permitted under AGPL-3.0
as long as you comply with its terms. You only need a commercial license if you
want to avoid AGPL obligations (like providing source code to network users per AGPL Section 13).

### Q: Do I need a license for each developer or each deployment?

**A:** Licensing is typically per-organization, not per-developer.
The number of deployments affects tier selection, not the base requirement
for a license.

### Q: What happens if I use Void Vault commercially without a license?

**A:** Unauthorized commercial use violates copyright law and the AGPL-3.0 terms.
We take enforcement seriously and will pursue legal action if necessary.
It's much simpler and more affordable to purchase a proper license.

### Q: Can I get a refund if the commercial license doesn't work for me?

**A:** Commercial licenses include a 30-day evaluation period.
Contact us if you have concerns during this period.
